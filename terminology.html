          <p class="space">
            <strong>Accretion</strong> - Accumulation of sand due to natural action of waves, currents and wind. A buildup of the

            <strong>Backshore</strong> – The part of the shoreline between the berm crest and the toe of the dunes or beach cliff.
            The backshore is often wider than the foreshore and slopes landward. Waves only reach the backshore during storms.</p>
          <p class="space">
            <strong>Bar</strong> - Fully or partly submerged mound of sand, built on the bottom in shallow water by waves and currents.</p>
          <p class="space">
            <strong>Barrier Island</strong> - A long, narrow, sandy island, representing a beach that is above high tide and parallel
            to the shore, commonly including dunes, grasslands with shrub zones, and marshes within the lagoon.</p>
          <p class="space">
            <strong>Barrier Spit</strong> – A narrow beach connected to the mainland or to a barrier island at one end, usually composed
            of sand deposited by the alongshore current.</p>

          <p class="space">
            <strong>Beach</strong> - A mobile deposit of sand extending from the toe of the dunes, from approximately 6 to 10 feet
            above mean sea level, seaward to water depths of minus-25 to minus-30 feet. The shapes of both the above- and
            below-water portions constantly adjust due to changing energy conditions.</p>
          <p class="space">
            <strong>Beachfill</strong> - Sand placed on a beach by mechanical methods.</p>
          <p class="space">
            <strong>Berm</strong> - A nearly horizontal part of the beach formed at or above the high-water line by waves depositing
            material. Some beaches have no berms; others have one or several.</p>
          <p class="space">
            <strong>Breakwater</strong> - Artificial or natural structure aligned parallel to the shoreline, sometimes shore-connected,
            that provides protection from waves.</p>

            <strong>Channel margin linear bars</strong> - Levee-like sand deposits built by the interaction of the ebb-tidal and
            flood-tidal currents with wave-generated currents. These bars flank the ebb channel.</p>
          <p class="space">
            <strong>Current, Longshore</strong> - Current in the breaker zone moving essentially parallel to shore, usually caused
            by waves breaking at an angle to shore. Also called alongshore current.</p>

          <p class="space">
            <strong>Ebb channel</strong> - The main and deeper tidal channel dominated by ebb-tidal currents (outgoing tide). Usually
            the channel is positioned closer to one of the adjacent barrier islands and its seaward extension is oriented
            at an angle to the adjacent shoreline. The seaward extension of the ebb channel is termed the outer-bar channel.</p>
          <p class="space">
            <strong>Ebb Shield</strong> – A high rim around the flood-tidal delta, protecting it from currents.</p>
          <p class="space">
            <strong>Ebb surge</strong> – The storm surge flowing from the sound to the ocean, typically caused by a hurricane moving
            inland or an inland hurricane moving offshore. The seaward-directed flow usually occupies low areas along the
            barriers and often results in development of inlets and temporary sluices or water channels in the islands’ surface.
            The return flow commonly enlarges existing inlets by eroding the adjacent shorelines. Sediments eroded from the
            island and inlets are deposited offshore some distance from land.</p>
          <p class="space">
            <strong>Ebb-tidal delta</strong> - A deposit of sand just seaward of a tidal inlet posing a hazard to navigation, but
            often protecting adjacent beaches from severe erosion through its breakwater effect.</p>
          <p class="space">
            <strong>Ebb-tidal delta breaching</strong> – the repositioning of the main channel across the ebb-tidal delta and the
            resulting movement of large sandbars to the landward regions of the shoals and the adjacent shorelines.</p>

            <strong>Flood ramp</strong> - Sloping sand on the flood-tidal delta where the incoming flood-tidal current diverges into
            several distinct flows.</p>
          <p class="space">
            <strong>Foreshore</strong> - The part of the shoreline between the crest of the seaward berm, or upper limit of wave
            wash, and the low-water line. The foreshore is ordinarily traversed by the run-up and backwash of the waves.</p>

        <h4 class="avenir-bold bottom">G</h4>
        <p class="space font-size--1">
          <strong>Groin</strong> - A low, narrow jetty-like feature constructed of a variety of materials, usually extending roughly
          perpendicular to the shoreline, designed to protect the beach from erosion or to trap sand for the purpose of building
          up a beach.</p>
