  <h3>Masonboro Inlet</h3>
  <p>Masonboro Inlet is a stabilized system that separates undeveloped Masonboro Island to the south from Wrightsville Beach,
    a developed barrier to the north. Historical charts from 1733 first document the inlet, which opened in the early 1700s,
    two kilometers north of its present location. The inlet now is located 1.8 kilometers north of its southernmost position
    on Masonboro Island. Since Masonboro Island became a component of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve
    in 1991, the dual jetty system that characterizes the inlet has sparked controversy over the erosion plaguing the island.</p>
  </br>
  <p>Fifteen years after the completion of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AIWW) in 1932, the inlet 's channel was artificially
    relocated at the southern end of a barrier spit extending northward from Masonboro Island. The project was designed to
    mitigate the erosion of Wrightsville Beach. The lagoon hydraulics also were altered when a sand dike was placed across
    the Shinn Creek access channel at its confluence with the AIWW.</p>
  </br>
  <p>In May 1950, a navigation project was proposed, calling for the construction of a 4.3-meter by 122-meter channel across
    the ebb-tidal delta, dual jetties and a series of access channels to the AIWW. The unique northern weir jetty was completed
    in June 1966 after difficulties were encountered in maintaining the channel by dredging. Within two years after completion
    of the north jetty, the ebb-tidal delta began to elongate in the north and the ebb channel repositioned itself. After
    several attempts to relocate the channel away from the north jetty, construction of a south jetty was recommended. The
    south jetty was completed in April 1981.</p>
