  <h3>Old Topsail Inlet</h3>
  <p>Old Topsail inlet is a relatively small, migratory system located approximately 2 kilometers south of Topsail Beach in
    Pender County. The inlet separates Lea Island to the north from Coke Island — or No Name Island — to the south. Both
    islands are low-profile, overwash-prone, undeveloped barriers. The inlet is locally known as Elmore's Inlet.</p>
  </br>
  <p>The inlet has opened and closed several times since 1995, and since October 1998 has been closed by a berm that built across
    the shallow, sand-choked throat. Storms reopen the breach and transport large volumes of material into the connecting
    channels within the marsh-filled lagoon. Each cycle of breach and repair further reduces the tidal prism, as the lagoon
    and its channels shoal.</p>
