  <h3>Cape Fear Inlet</h3>
  <p>The Cape Fear River Inlet is the largest inlet system in southeastern North Carolina. The inlet separates the Caswell Beach
    spit to the west from Bald Head Island to the east — the largest and southernmost barrier island making up the Cape Fear
    foreland. The ebb channel serves as the entry to Wilmington harbor, the state’s primary commercial port, approximately
    40 kilometers upstream of the estuary’s entrance.</p>
  </br>
  <p>Dredging of the estuary entrance began in 1829. Major improvements to the ebb channel began in 1871, when the channel dimensions
    were increased to 3.6 meters by 30 meters. Since the late 19th century, the entrance channel has been progressively widened
    and deepened to its 1999 dimensions of 12.2 meters by 152 meters. Altogether, approximately 50 million cubic meters of
    material have been dredged from the entrance channel. By 2005, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will have deepened the
    ebb channel an additional 1.2 meters, and aligned it to a more southeasterly orientation.</p>
  </br>
  <p>Since dredging began in the 1880s, the cross-sectional area of the entrance channel has increased from 9,235 square meters
    in 1881 to 11,225 square meters in 1985. Although data suggest that the ebb-tidal delta volume should increase from a
    larger cross-sectional area and thus, a larger tidal prism, calculations show that the ebb-tidal delta has lost approximately
    15.6 million cubic meters of sediment.</p>
