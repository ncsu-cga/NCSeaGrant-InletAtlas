  <h3>Lockwood Folly Inlet</h3>
  <p>Lockwood Folly Inlet is located along the low-energy, western flank of Cape Fear, approximately 25 kilometers west of the
    Cape Fear River. Historic maps indicate that the inlet existed as early as 1672. Two rapidly developing public beach
    communities border Lockwood Folly Inlet. Holden Beach, to the west, is characterized by some of the highest inlet-induced
    erosion rates in southeastern North Carolina. Long Beach, to the east, currently is experiencing inlet-induced shoreline
    accretion along the western margin of the barrier spit.</p>
  </br>
  <p>Maps from the 16th and 17th centuries indicate that the inlet migrated along approximately two kilometers of the western
    segment of Long Beach. The presence of extensive peat outcrops and relict tree stumps along the Holden Beach shoulder
    indicate that the inlet has not migrated west of its current location for several centuries. The geographic position
    of the inlet has remained relatively stable since 1938, although the ebb0channel position and orientation have changed
    significantly. The midpoint of the channel has migrated approximately 150 meters to the east since 1938, at a rate of
    2.5 meters per year.</p>
