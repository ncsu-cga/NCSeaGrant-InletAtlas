  <h3>Tubbs Inlet</h3>
  <p>Tubbs Inlet is a relatively small, migratory inlet approximately 45 kilometers west of Cape Fear. The inlet separates two
    developed barrier islands: Ocean Isle to the east and Sunset Beach to the west. The inlet drains a marsh-filled lagoon
    and is fed by two tidal channels, Jinks and Still Creeks. Jinks Creek drains the western portion of the lagoon and appears
    to be the main feeder channel</p>
  </br>
  <p>The inlet has a complex migration history that includes an artificial relocation of the inlet, the shoaling of Still Creek
    and the dredging of Jinks Creek over the past 60 years. Since 1980, the inletâ€™s migration also may have been influenced
    by the dual-jetty system of sediment-rich Little River Inlet, located approximately 6 kilometers to the west.</p>
  </br>
  <p>Sunset Beach, to the west of the inlet, is one of the few beaches in North Carolina to experience net shoreline accretion
    over the past century. The progressive buildup of this oceanfront shorelines is due in large part to the combined influences
    of Tubbs and Mad Inlets, which flank the short barrier island.</p>
