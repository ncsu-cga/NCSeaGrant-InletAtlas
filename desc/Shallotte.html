  <h3>Shallotte Inlet</h3>
  <p>Shallotte Inlet is a stable inlet along the low-energy flank of Cape Fear foreland, approximately 38 kilometers west of
    the Cape Fear River. Historic maps and coastal charts indicate that the inlet has existed for at least 300 years. Two
    rapidly developing public beach communities border the inlet: Holden Beach to the east and Ocean Isle to the west. Ocean
    Isle is a 9-kilometer barrier island experiencing chronic erosion in the vicinity of Shallotte Inlet. Holden Beach is
    a 13-kilometer barrier island experiencing inlet-related accretion downdrift of Shallotte Inlet. Multiple dune ridges
    associated with the accretion of the shoreline characterize the inlet-influenced segment of Holden Beach.</p>
  </br>
  <p>Shallotte Inlet’s geographic position has remained relatively stable, with only slight fluctuations since 1938. Net movement
    has been to the west. Although the midpoint of the channel has not changed appreciably, the shoulders have eroded significantly
    due to the channel’s reorientation from southwest to southeast between 1938 and 1996.</p>
