  <h3>New Inlet</h3>
  <p>The current New Inlet separates Smith Island to the south from a 3.7-kilometer barrier spit extending southwest from Fort
    Fisher to the north. Opened in the early 1940s near the spit’s attachment to the mainland, New Inlet is the latest in
    a number of small inlets that have opened, migrated and closed along the barrier-spit shoreline extending south from
    the headland.</p>
  </br>
  <p>The largest of these historic inlets also was called New Inlet. Historic New Inlet, which was used by the blockade-runners
    during the Civil War, was an extremely large inlet that opened in an area called The Haulover during an intense 1761
    hurricane. The inlet was blocked artificially in 1881 as a result of the construction of a 1.6-kilometer-long, 9.1-meter-high
    rock dam that extended across the inlet at its junction with the Cape Fear River. An additional 3-kilometer-long extension
    to south was built in 1887.</p>
  </br>
  <p>The dam almost stopped the flow of water through the inlet, reducing the tidal prism dramatically and prompting the inlet
    to migrate rapidly to the south. For the six years following the construction of the dam, the inlet’s migration rates
    ranged from 580 meters per year to as much as 1 kilometer per year.</p>
